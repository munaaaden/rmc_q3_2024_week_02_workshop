Global Disease Burden Analysis
================
Muna Aden

# Introduction

This document compares the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) diseases
burden for three countries: COUNTRY 1, COUNTRY 2, and COUNTRY 3. We
compare the burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and
nutritional diseases (CMNN), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and
overall disease burden for these countries.

The source data is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
(IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.

## Summary of CMNN Burden Findings

Angola’s DALY Burden has been decreasing gradually since 1990. This is
the country that had the highest DALY in 1990. Afghanistans DALY Burden
has also been decreasing gradually even though not at a consistent rate
as Angola. Finally, Argentina has always had the lowest DALY Burden
which has also been gradually reducing since 1990.
