# Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Disease Burden (CMNN)

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries.
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_cmnn_wide  <- pivot_wider(data_cmnn_mini, names_from = Entity, values_from = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
kable(data_cmnn_wide, caption = "DALY Burden Over Time for Data")
```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
ggplot(data_cmnn_mini, aes(x = Year, y = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`, color = Entity, group = Entity)) +

## Summary of CMNN Burden Findings

Angola's DALY Burden has been decreasing gradually since 1990. This is the country that had  the highest DALY in  1990. Afghanistans DALY Burden has also been decreasing gradually even though not at a consistent rate as  Angola. Finally, Argentina has always had the lowest DALY Burden which has also been gradually reducing since 1990.
